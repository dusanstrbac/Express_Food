# EXPRESS FOOD DELIVERY APP
# Version 1.0
Simple react project with MongoDB for ordering food.
Currently in this version of the app only index page was created.

# Version 1.1
For version 1.1 of the project I will be focusing on the "Log in" and "Sign up" functions.
Creating custom pages for both functions that will allow person to create account and save it in the database.
Forgot password will be included so you can retrive your account via email address.
